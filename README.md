# PTPOffsetMon

The PTPOffsetMon application is built for the Cisco NX-OS range of Data Center switches (Nexus 9000).  

The application leverages the NX-SDK toolset.

The source application PTPOffsetMon.py can be run in the BASH shell of the NXOS switch.

Alternative the RPM can be installed and then the application run as a service.  This would be the most
desirable method.  Details on how to install RPM on NXOS devices can be found at:-
